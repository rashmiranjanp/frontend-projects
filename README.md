# Weather-Forecasting App
The Weather Forecasting App is a simple and interactive web application that allows users to check the current weather and forecast for any city or location. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the frontend and fetches real-time weather data using a weather API (like OpenWeatherMap) via a JavaScript API key.
